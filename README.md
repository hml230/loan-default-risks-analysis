## Background and Introduction

This project is a port to PyTorch from a collaborated project I did. The task proposed selection of a loan/credit default dataset and develop classification models to predict or investigate factors that influence whether a borrower would default, recorded as `0` (non-default) or `1` (default) in the `default_ind` variable.

The networks were previously in Tensorflow, but I saw PyTorch offered a better interface and development experimence, so I ported them.

In this exercise, I investigated a variation of the LoanStatNew dataset using PyTorch. I performed dimensionality reduction, features selection and class weighting to compare the performance of different model architectures.

See the notebooks here: [Analysis Notebook](./src/data-processing_visualisation.ipynb) and [Training Notebook](./src/preprocessing_model-fitting.ipynb)

## Sourcing data

The dataset is a variation of Kaggle's Lending Club dataset. with addition features that were created based on the original dataset. It offers a wide view of different aspects in the borrowers' financial status, and a high flexibility for model selection.

The [data dictionary with schema definiton](./data_dict.md) can be found in the `.md` file.

## Data Transformation

The proposed processing pipeline includes the following steps:

- Dropping a range of columns that were deemed uninformative or have high proportion of missing values

- Dropping rows (sice data size was adequate) for columns that have low missingness, including the target, `default_ind`

- Transforming the time-based columns into Timestamp type, stored as number of days since **1970-01-01**

- Preprocess remaining categorical or numerical variables using MLlib's `StringIndexer()` estimator and casting respectively

- Used median to fill any missing or 'Unknown' values after acquiring the **train set**

Overall, the dataset's quality is relatively high, no inconsistent string values that require `regex` were found. The only other prominent issue is class imbalance, which was alleviated using class weights.

| default_ind | count |
|-----------|------|
|0 |647004 |
|1 | 37149 |

A design change I made that's different to the original work was to store processed data in `.parquet` format instead of `.csv`. Originally, code was written in a single Colab notebook so we didn't have issues with replication as we used the `.toPandas()` method to convert dataset into tensors via numpy.

After visualising the underlying patterns of the dataset, we employed `compute_class_weight()` from scikit-learn to calculate the bias for model training.

## Building the models

Using `nn.Module`, I created 3 classes, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a bagging model with MLP base models and a convolutional network (CNN) with 1-D convolution layers. The models' architecture are relatively simple as I initially built them using Keras' documentation.

The first two model has some Dense/Linear layers, while the CNN has the usual design. All models are validated using a `DataLoader` instance crated from the validation set.

```python
val_loader = DataLoader(val_tensor_ds, 
                        batch_size=32, 
                        shuffle=False, 
                        pin_memory=True if device.type == 'cuda' else False)
```

## Evaluation

- The MLP and bagging model achieved high performance, with precision and recall ~99%.

  - The inclusion of class weights in the loss function may have reduced the selection bias within these models and may have improved the results.

- The CNN model performed noticeably worse to the other two, which is expected CNNs are not typically fit on tabular data.

- The area under the curve (AUC) are close to 1 across all networks, meaning they are very likely to make the correct classification.

  - This high AUC result also suggests potential overfitting, but regularlisation/normalisation was applied, so this suggests presence of leakage.

Below is the summary of the Tensorflow models' performance on the **test set**.

|Model | Accuracy| AUC | Precision | Recall | Loss | False Negative Count |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Multilayer Perceptron | 0.9981 | 0.9992 | 0.9763 | 0.9884 | 0.0313 | 107.0 |
| Ensemble MLP |0.9958| 0.9984 | 0.9378 | 0.9868 | 0.0506 | 122.0 |
| 1D Convolutional Network | 0.9651 | 0.9651 | 0.7551 | 0.5254 | 0.1647 | 4394.0|

```

The convolutional network was not able to classify the other label during test, possible causing 0 precision and recall despite having informative AUC and Accuracy.

## Conclusion

We've prototyped tree-based models previously, which were more robust and achieved better performance compared to neural networks. On the other hand, PyTorch's interface offers a nice development experience and is easier to scale with its CUDA integration.
